    Using the iterutils, figure out the number of permutations possible when
    rolling two 6-sided dice. (Hint: Think cartesian product, not the
    permutations function.)
    
    Print the total number of permutations.
    
    Make a simple ascii chart that displays the count of permutations for
    a particular combination (i.e. sum of a permutation).
    
    Example:
    
    3 *
    4 **
    ... etc...
