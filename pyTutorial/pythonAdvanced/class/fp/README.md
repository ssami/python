Functional (and procedural) programming
=======================================
[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [procedural programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) are related in that they often rely on function constructs, provided by some programming language, to do work on data.

For the sake of this discussion, we are going to work in the realm of functional and procedural code, and will just mean, "working with functions, functional helpers, and some function oriented syntactic constructs" in Python.



Tools available to the functional programmer
--------------------------------------------
Python provides a lot of tools for functional programming, many of the tools being builtins. Run and review `examples/iterableutilities.py`.



Decorators
----------
Whether going the procedural, functional, or OOP route, decorators are often used in Python, especially when using a Framework. Run and review `examples/decorators.py`.
