<h1 id="object-oriented-programming">Object-oriented programming</h1>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_oriented_programming">Object-oriented programming</a>, or OOP, is a way of programming that approaches problems, challenges, data, and even processes from an noun-centric point of view. If I was building a digital farm, I might have Animal objects that have data fields representing traits, and functions, or methods, that represent what the animal can do. If I was running a bulletin board, I might have Users, Forums, Messages, and other objects representing the data and activities allowed on my board.</p>
<p>Unlike a language like Java, Python expresses itself as an OOP language along with other paradigms. Mastering OOP in Python is a part of the path along which one travels to master Python as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="tools-available-to-the-oop-programmer-in-python">Tools available to the OOP programmer in Python</h2>
<p>OOP is more of a style of programming that is dependent on the language one is in. We want to take a look at some of the not-immediately-obvious features of OOP prgramming in Python.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>Run <code>examples/basic.py</code> and walk through the code to review some of the way OOP is expressed in Python.</p>
<h2 id="metaclasses-and-interfaces">Metaclasses and Interfaces</h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to use OOP in Python is mainly due to the amount of power it provides the developer. Run <code>examples/abstract_and_interfaces.py</code> and walk through the code.</p>
<ul>
<li>see: <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/abc.html">The Python Abstract Base Class</a></li>
<li>see: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6581949">Metaclasses, what are they? (a long but good answer on stackoverflow)</a></li>
<li>see: <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html">Python Data Model, class interfaces and overrides</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiple-inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</h2>
<p>Python exhibits what is called multiple inheritance, where one object can inherit from more than one immediate parent.</p>
<p>Run <code>examples/mi.py</code> and walk through the code.</p>
<p>Multiple inheritance is difficult to do right, but can be useful with patience and in certain situations. Open up the code in <code>examples/mi.py</code> and comment out the update functions. Why does the code still work?</p>

<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>
<p>Go through the labs to exercise some of the not-always used features of OOP in Python, as well as some of the regularly used features.</p>
