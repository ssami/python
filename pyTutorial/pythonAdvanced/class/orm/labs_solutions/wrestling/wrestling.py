"""
LAB:

This is a simple game that runs a simple wrestling match. Wrestlers are
the main data, and currently the game uses the Python sqlite3 module
to persist data.

Tasks:
* Test wrestling.py to make sure you are aware of how the code works.
* Remove all need for the db.py file.
* Replace the existing wrestler.py file with a declared SQLAlchemy ORM
  solution.
    * If done correctly, you should not need to touch wrestling.py.
* Test wrestling.py again and make sure things work as expected.
