""" File IO simple lab:

    Ask the user for their name.
    Ask the user for their favorite color.
    Fail politely if the user puts a : character in the name or color.
    Use a try/except and watch for IOError.
    Write the name:color to the file "echo_out.txt".
    Before exiting, echo back all of the contents of the file, splitting
    on the colon and formatting the name in a left aligned fixed width
    field of 20.
    Run this multiple times to make sure it is working as expected.
