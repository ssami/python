    Import our genpass function from our comprehensions module.
    Use it within a list comprehension to build a list of 10 passwords
    of length 20 using ascii letters, ascii digits, and ascii punctuation.
    When calling genpass, expand the list of arguments using the * notation.
    Enumerate and print out the passwords.
    
    Does our if __name__ == "__main__" code in our comprehensions module
    run? If not, why not? (This can be observed in the console, or rather
    by the lack of output in the console.)
