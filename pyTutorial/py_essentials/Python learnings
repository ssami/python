Python learnings

1. dir() 
2. dir(module)
3. help(math) 
4. Doc string: first string 
5. Remember! You need to convert between types! Python is considered strongly typed so it doesn't do string-int conversions automatically
6. Lists are not arrays
7. if __name__ == "__main__":
8. Two underscores: python special variables: don't make new ones on your own
9. Python doesn't use global variables
9. Lists in parentheses are tuples: immutable and can be unpacked into variables
	9a. a, b, c = tuple
10. Sets work just like Math
11. No increments/decrements: sum += 1
12. Strings with r will help you escape characters! This is great in creating regex patterns
13. Counter! from collections import Counter
14. Slices: list[10:20:2] - from 10 to 20 objects, every other object. Last 10 objects, list[-5:]
15. No such thing as global scope!
16. No block scoping! Only def: function scoping
17. Two ways to initialize dictionaries: 
	a = {
    'a': 'value',
    'another': 'value',
}

b = dict( 
    a='value',
    another='value',
)
18. Self is passed in automatically when calling a function
19. if name == main: makes sure that nothing runs immediately when you import
20. Running something with if name == main: call it as python <classname>.py
21. Make sure every method has self!
22. 


Python Advanced learnings
1. install virtual env if you're not sure what you're doing/installing!
	export WORKON_HOME=<something>
	mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
	source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
	mkvirtualenv env1

	To exit, get out of shell 
	To reenter, type: 
	source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
	workon env1
