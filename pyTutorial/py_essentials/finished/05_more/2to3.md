2to3
====

Python has some differences between version 2 and 3. The big differences have been backported to version 2.7. Using the 2to3 tool, you will at least be able to see what is different.

Using the tool is pretty simple, from the command line:

    2to3 somepythonfile.py

And if you're feeling brave (which is why we have source control):

    2to3 -w somepythonfile.py
